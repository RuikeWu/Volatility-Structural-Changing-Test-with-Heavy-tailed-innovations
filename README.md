# Volatility-Structural-Changing-Test-with-Heavy-tailed-innovations
Two robust test statistics to detect structural changes in volatility in the presence of heavy-tailed innovations. 

Edited by Ruike Wu

The codes shared are related to the paper titled "Testing for Structural Changes in Volatility with Heavy-tailed Innovations and Its Empirical Applications," 
(厚尾数据的波动率结构变化检验及应用研究), which will be published in Statistical Research (统计研究).

The test function is named "Vol_structural_change_test.m", and its application on the log return data of the dollar-to-rouble exchange rate is explored in "EmpiricalApplication.m."
